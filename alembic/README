# Alembic Migrations for UniFi Toolkit

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Creating a New Migration

To auto-generate a migration after making model changes:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

To create an empty migration (for manual SQL):

```bash
alembic revision -m "Description of changes"
```

## Running Migrations

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

To upgrade to a specific version:

```bash
alembic upgrade <revision_id>
```

To downgrade one version:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Checking Migration Status

To see current database version:

```bash
alembic current
```

To see migration history:

```bash
alembic history
```

## Important Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before running them
- Test migrations in a development environment first
- The database URL is loaded from your .env file
- SQLite is used by default (supports batch operations for ALTER TABLE)
